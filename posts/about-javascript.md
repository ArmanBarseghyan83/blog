# JavaScript

JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Website client-side usage

JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 98% of all websites (midâ€“2022) using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.

### Examples of scripted behavior

- Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.
- Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.
- Playing browser games.
- Controlling the playback of streaming media.
- Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.
- Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.
- Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.
- Redirecting a user to another page.
- Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.
